#Module 7: Critical Thinking Assignment - Course Information System

#Introduction
This assignment challenged me to create a comprehensive course information system using Python dictionaries. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data organization, user input handling, and creating interactive programs. The main objective was to develop a system that could efficiently store and retrieve course information based on user queries.

Challenges and Learning Experiences
Technical Challenges
Data Structure Selection: Deciding to use separate dictionaries for each type of information (rooms, instructors, times) rather than nested dictionaries. This approach made the code more readable and maintainable.

Input Validation: Implementing robust input handling to accommodate different capitalization formats (e.g., "csc101" vs "CSC101") and prevent program crashes from invalid entries.

User Experience: Designing an interface that allows continuous queries without requiring program restart, which involved implementing a while loop with a clear exit condition.

Key Learnings
Dictionary Efficiency: I learned how dictionaries provide O(1) lookup time, making them ideal for this type of data retrieval system where quick access to values based on keys is essential.

Error Handling: This project reinforced the importance of anticipating user errors and handling them gracefully without breaking program flow.

Code Organization: I discovered that breaking data into multiple focused dictionaries, rather than one complex nested structure, often leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.

User Interface Design: Creating a system that provides clear instructions, feedback, and easy navigation significantly improves the user experience.
